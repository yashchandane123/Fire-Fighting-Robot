# Fire Fighting Robot

This project involves the design and development of a fire-fighting robot. It is a minor hardware project that aims to demonstrate the potential of robotic systems in detecting and extinguishing fires in controlled environments.

## Key Features

- **Fire Detection:** Equipped with sensors to detect fire and smoke.
- **Mobility:** The robot is capable of moving autonomously to locate the fire source.
- **Fire Extinguishing Mechanism:** Includes a system to spray water or other extinguishing agents.

## Project Details

- **Type:** Minor Hardware Project
- **Components Used:**
  - Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
  - Fire sensors (e.g., IR sensors, flame sensors)
  - DC motors and motor driver
  - Water pump and nozzle
  - Chassis and wheels for mobility
- **Power Supply:** Battery-powered system for autonomous operation.

## How It Works

1. **Fire Detection:** Sensors continuously monitor the environment for fire or heat signatures.
2. **Navigation:** The robot uses a predefined algorithm to navigate toward the fire source.
3. **Extinguishing Fire:** Once the fire source is detected, the extinguishing mechanism is activated to spray water or other agents to suppress the fire.

## Applications

- Educational demonstrations of robotic systems.
- Testing concepts for future automated fire-fighting technologies.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of electronics and programming.
- Access to hardware components like microcontrollers, sensors, and motors.

## Usage

1. Assemble the hardware components according to the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the control code to the microcontroller.
3. Place the robot in a controlled environment with a small fire source for testing.
4. Observe its ability to detect and extinguish the fire.

This project serves as a stepping stone for more advanced fire-fighting robotic systems, showcasing how automation can enhance safety and efficiency in emergency situations.
